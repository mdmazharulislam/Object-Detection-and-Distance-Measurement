# Object-Detection-and-Distance-Measurement

This repository contains object_detection in python which is able to perform the following task -

    - Object detection from live video frame or in a image
    - Counting the number of objects in a frame and segmentation
    - Measuring the distance of object using depth information

For object detection YOLO-V3 has been used which is able to detect 80 different objects. Some of those are-

    - person
    - car
    - bus
    - stop sign
    - bench
    - dog
    - bear
    - backpack and so on.

## Theory

In a traditional image classification approach for object detection there are two well-known strategies.

For single object in a image there are two scenarios.

    1. Classification
    2. Localization

For multiple objects in a image there are two scenarios.

    1. Object detection and localization
    2. Object segmentation
